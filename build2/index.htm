<h1>About Mark</h1>

<p>Mark Johnson, born in Stockport in 1980 began learning the piano at the age of nine. Within four 
years he entered a performance competition and was successfully chosen as understudy to appear 
on stage with Richard Clayderman at The Stockport Davenport Theatre.</p>

<p>In 1995 he was awarded with an end of year trophy at Bramhall High School for 'Most Outstanding Musical 
Contribution' and locally his composition skills became apparent when he won first prize in the 
'Harmony '96-Bramhall Music Festival'.</p>

<p>Mark studied A Level Music at Stockport's Aquinas College and was accepted to play in the college 
orchestra. In 1998 and 1999 he respectively participated in the orchestra's tours to Prague and 
Venice. During that time he enhanced his individual composition style and in 1998 was successful 
in writing a jingle for the &quot;Wake up to Coldseal&quot; radio promotion. It inspired him to produce 
ensemble material for each end of season concert and allowed him to proficiently showcase his 
piano talent. Mark has also performed one of his compositions at the Bridgewater Hall with Mike 
Hall (1955 - 2008), who was an established violinist for the Halle (special character) orchestra 
and BBC Philharmonic.</p>

<p>Mark passed the prestigious Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music(ABRSM) Grade 8 
piano exam while studying at the University of Huddersfield, under the teaching guidance 
of orchestral pianist Ian Buckle. Upon graduating in 2002 he set up his own piano and theory 
tuition business, providing lessons in and around Bramhall, for pupils of all ages and abilities.</p>

<p>The piano music which Mark plays at civil ceremonies, wedding breakfasts, parties and other 
private functions is a sophisticated blend of popular ballads, jazz standards, and light 
classical pieces. His style creates the perfect atmosphere for any special occasion.</p>
